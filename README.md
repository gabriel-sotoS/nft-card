## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Started to think about CSS Flex Items Manipulation and learned how to make a better use of the Flexbox and custom properties. I'm growing on my way in HTML5 and CSS. Unfortunately, i could not make the hover effect in the image.

### Continued development

Manipulate Flex Items, better thinking with HTML and CSS and continue learning JS for future projects.
